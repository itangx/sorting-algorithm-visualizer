# Sorting Visualizer #
I created this application to learn how it works and also remind me when I forgot how to use it.  
This application supports the following algorithms:

| Algorithm  | Time Complexity (Worst) | Space Complexity |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Selection  |          O(n^2)         |       O(1)       |  
| Bubble     |          O(n^2)         |       O(1)       |
| Insertion  |          O(n^2)         |       O(1)       |
| Merge      |        O(nlog(n))       |       O(n)       |
| Quick      |          O(n^2)         |     O(nlog(n))   |
| Heap       |        O(nlog(n))       |       O(1)       |
| Counting   |         O(n + k)        |       O(k)       |
